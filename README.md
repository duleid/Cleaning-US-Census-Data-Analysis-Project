\section{Introduction}
This project focuses on the analysis of census data and the creation of informative visualizations and insights using Python and the pandas library. As a Data Analyst at the Census Bureau, the objective is to transform the existing data processing workflow, which currently involves manual searching through CSV files and manual chart creation in Excel, into a scalable and repeatable process.

\section{Project Goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Import the most recent census data, stored in multiple CSV files, into pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
  \item Transform the data into a structured and manageable format, ensuring its suitability for various statistical analyses and visualization techniques.
  \item Generate scatterplots and histograms based on specific requirements from the project stakeholders.
  \item Streamline the data processing workflow to improve efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility.
  \item Establish a foundation for data-driven decision-making at the Census Bureau and enable the creation of insightful visualizations and valuable insights from the census data.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Python scripts for data import, transformation, and visualization using pandas.
  \item Visualizations, including scatterplots and histograms, showcasing key insights from the census data.
  \item Documentation outlining the project objectives, methodologies, and key findings.
  \item README file providing instructions for running the scripts and reproducing the visualizations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Technologies Used}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Python
